![Rocket.Chat GSoC Contributions Leaderboard screenshot](images/contributing-list.png)

A contributions leaderboard for your GSoC organization. Students can track their position on leaderboard based on the PRs, commits, and issues they've completed across the repositories of your organization on Github.

## Benefits
- Encourage students to improve their position - by increasing contribution to your organization
- Easy to setup and administer
- Realtime organization-wide visibility to top student candidates

## Main Features
- Track commits/PRs/issues for GSoC student candidates in real time
- At a glance view of participating top students
- Easy administration to add students (even before they have made their very first contribution)

## Quick Start

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhsherl/GSoC-Contribution-Leaderboard.git
```

Create a `python3` virtual environment, activate it and install the required packages
```
bash
virtualenv venv -p python3
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a file name `.env` in the base directory (alongside manage.py) and
Add your Github Auth Token and Organization name in it as following

```
ORGANIZATION=''
GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN=''
```

Apply database migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Finally, run the development server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

To run it in background and serve on any port (eg. 3003)
```bash
nohup python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:3003 &
```
(For production use follow a proper method for deploying a django app in production)

To create an admin user run
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Start the refresh script

###  Architecture

- The refresh script fetches contributions of users marked as GSoC candidates to selected repositories.
- By default all the repositories are used for counting contributions and no user is marked as GSoC candidate.
- A superuser/admin must mark the users as GSoC candidates, and can choose to not use certain repositories for counting contributions.
- Both the django application and the refresh script run on seperate threads.

###  Running the refresh script

`nohup sh refresh.sh &`

#### Initiailization:  First steps

- Click on refresh at the home page to sync your db with the latest repositories from your Organization.
- Visit `/admin`, mark the Repositories from which you want to count contributions.
- Mark users as GSoC contributors under Core>Users form the admin panel.

##### Admin levels:
- **Exclude Repo:** Decide which Repo to count for LeaderBoard
- **Moderator:** The above plus the ability to add/remove users
